# 5D-Digital-Data-Storage
5D digital data storage uses nanostructured glass and femtosecond lasers to store data in five dimensions—3D position, light intensity, and polarization. It can hold up to 360TB per disc and last billions of years, making it ultra-durable, high-capacity, and ideal for long-term data archiving.
